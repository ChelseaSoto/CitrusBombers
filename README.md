The goal is to locate the hidden exit that is discovered 
by destroying one of the many sandcastles found throughout 
each level. These sandcastles, along with any pesky knights 
along the way, are destroyed by strategically placing 
citrobombs and quickly evading the explosion that follows. 
Be sure to collect any ducklings that appear; these provide 
temporary powerups! Pink ducklings extend the citrobomb's 
explosive range while yellow ducklings expand active 
citrobomb capacity.<br />
